# MartianRobots

#####Testing the app with custom input
Please, put the input text into the input.txt file. The output is printed into console.

#####Introducting new commands for robots
If you need to introduce new instructions for robots, all you need to do is to modify Robot.java file to let a robot 
know what is should do when gets this instruction. The rest of the code should work without any modification.

#####What could be done further?
Currently an instruction is ignored by a robot depending only on its orientation on a border cell. However, there might 
be multiple conditions, that together would lead to ignoring of an instruction. This is not taken into account in the 
current version of the app.
